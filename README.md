# Adaline (Adaptive Linear Neuron) - Python Implementation

This project implements the **Adaline (Adaptive Linear Neuron)** algorithm using Python and NumPy. Adaline is a **single-layer neural network** that uses **linear activation** and the **Least Mean Squares (LMS)** learning rule. It is widely used for **linear regression** and **binary classification tasks**.
